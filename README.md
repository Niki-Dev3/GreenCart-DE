# GreenCart E-Commerce ETL Pipeline
## Project Overview

GreenCart is a growing e-commerce startup. The sales team needs daily insights on revenue, customer behavior, and product performance. Currently, they only have raw CSV exports from their operational system.

This project implements a complete ETL pipeline that:

Ingests raw CSV data

Cleanses and transforms it

Loads it into a structured star schema suitable for analytics

Supports CI/CD with automated testing and linting

The pipeline is designed to work locally or in a cloud-like CI/CD environment using MariaDB.
